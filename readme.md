# Controller Debug Tool

## How to use
* Run tool in console, and plug in a controller to start testing mappings.
* Not all controllers are guaranteed to be supported, as I only tested for the controllers I have (Dualshock 4, PS Classic Controller, Mayflash F700)

Special thanks to mdqinc's [SDL_GameControllerDB](https://github.com/mdqinc/SDL_GameControllerDB)
and the SDL community for compiling a list of controller mappings to simplify the HID Profile functions.
